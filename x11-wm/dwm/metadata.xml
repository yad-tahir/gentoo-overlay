A custom version of dwm, a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in
tiling and floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed. Various
patches applied dwm to make it more powerful and applicable to ultra monitor
setups.
